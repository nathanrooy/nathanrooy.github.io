After plugging it in and exploring it for a few minutes, I came across all my old thesis stuff. Seeing how this was before I started using GitHub, I figured I would post it in hopes that someone else could get some use from it. Even though it uses older versions of both Blender and OpenFOAM, the results should still be perfectly acceptable given that the equations of fluid dynamics haven't changed much in the last hundred years.</description></item></channel></rss>
