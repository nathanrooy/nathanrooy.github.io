I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the answer to the question, but it got me thinking about what else has changed over time in Cincinnati in regards to maps and names? Luckly the Cincinnati Public Library Digital Archives has a wealth of information on just this topic.
I ended up downloading about a dozen maps ranging from as early as 1815 to as recent as 1900.</description></item><item><title>Mapping the Chili Regions of Cincinnati [two year update]</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2018-02-01/chili-regions-of-cincinnati-updated/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2018-02-01/chili-regions-of-cincinnati-updated/</guid><description>Roughly two yeas ago I wrote my first post on here, in which I created a voronoi diagram depicting the chili regions of Cincinnati. Each region corresponded to being closer to either Skyline Chili or Gold Star Chili. Since a voronoi tessellation is based off Euclidean distance (&amp;ldquo;as the crow flies&amp;rdquo;), its usefulness diminishes considerably when applied to street networks. Because we&amp;rsquo;re not yet traveling around using jetpacks, I modified the distance function to use something called network distance which is calculated using Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s algorithm.</description></item><item><title>The Beautiful Commute: Visualizing one full year of bike commuting in Cincinnati</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2018-01-11/one-year-of-bike-commuting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2018-01-11/one-year-of-bike-commuting/</guid><description>Introduction 2017 was an interesting year in terms of my daily commute. Although I unfortunately own a car, I refuse to waste my life mired in a quagmire of traffic like some kind of suburban commuter. This means I&amp;rsquo;m biking everywhere, or taking transit. But not like one of those weird weekend warriors dressed head to toe in fluorescent lycra, more like hoodie and sweat pants. What made 2017 interesting was the fact that not only did I move around several times, but being apart of a rapidly growing tech startup, so did my office.</description></item><item><title>Do We Actually Need to Replace the Western Hills Viaduct?</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2017-11-29/western-hills-viaduct-spatial-analysis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2017-11-29/western-hills-viaduct-spatial-analysis/</guid><description>Introduction and Background If you live in the Cincinnati area, by now you should have heard that the Western Hills Viaduct is in a fairly dire situation at the moment and calls for a replacement have reached an almost fevered pitch. While all this squealing for a replacement has been going on, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if a replacement was actually what Cincinnati needs? As it currently stands, it requires $1 million per year just to maintain and a replacement is expected to cost $335 million.</description></item><item><title>Mapping the Age of Cincinnati</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2017-02-15/the-age-of-cincinnati/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2017-02-15/the-age-of-cincinnati/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been really impressed by those &amp;ldquo;age of&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; maps that I see from time to time on the internet (see here, here, and here) so I thought I would give it a go this winter while I had a little free time. Between web scraping and actual map creation it ended up taking a little over a month to finish.

The map was originally created by J.S. Reed in 1975. They achieved this by looking through the yellow pages and counting the businesses that included &amp;ldquo;Southern&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;American&amp;rdquo;. From this data, they were able to create the contour map seen below (Google Books version here).</description></item><item><title>Montréal’s Language Distribution According to Twitter…</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-09-01/language-of-montreal-according-to-twitter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-09-01/language-of-montreal-according-to-twitter/</guid><description>Over the span of roughly eight months I was able to collect 1,116,442 tweets using the Tweepy Python library which facilitates easy access to the free Twitter API. If eight months sounds like a long time for only a ~1M tweets, that’s because the free Twitter API only gives access to roughly 1% of the total Twitter stream or “firehose”. Since saving the actual tweet goes against the user agreement, I only saved a lat/lon location and a language type within a single SQL database.</description></item><item><title>Cincy to Dayton and Back by Bike / My First Century!</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-08-31/cincy-to-dayton-bike-ride/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-08-31/cincy-to-dayton-bike-ride/</guid><description>Since I had some time off recently, I decided to finally try and bike to Dayton and back in one day. I bike everyday to and from work, so the idea of biking long distances simply to log miles isn’t that appealing to me. I’m not some suburban spandex wearing weekend warrior with a bike rack on my car. Still, the challenge has taunted me for a while and it sounded fun.</description></item><item><title>Mapping the White Castle/Krystal Divide</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-08-01/white-castle-krystal-divide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-08-01/white-castle-krystal-divide/</guid><description>Ahh White Castle. I’ve had a love/hate relationship with this place since college. Sometimes after a solid night of pillaging and conquering, nothing satisfies your hunger like those little square, steamed devil burgers. Give me a ten sack and life is good. Add in some tots and a side of ranch? Game over. Good night. As for Krystal, I had it once on the way to Panama for Spring Break. It was alright… And that’s the end of that story.</description></item><item><title>Mapping out IHOP vs. Waffle House</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-03-23/ihop-vs-waffle-house/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-03-23/ihop-vs-waffle-house/</guid><description>So I had never actually been to a Waffle House until they put the one in across from Stab and Grab in Clifton. I have to say though, I’m questioning my loyalty to Toppers as my post-rage food source. The second time I went there it was all still so new to me that I splurged a bit and ordered “the left side of the menu”. It was the best meal of my life…</description></item><item><title>Dog Ownership in Cincinnati [map]</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-03-12/dog-ownership-in-cincinnati/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-03-12/dog-ownership-in-cincinnati/</guid><description>In Cincinnati, there&amp;rsquo;s a pomeranian named Michelle Obama. There’s also a Beagle named Sarah Palin, a German Shepherd named Obwan Kenobi, and a Pit Bull Terrier named Beyoncé. Actually there’s a total of six dogs named Beyoncé in Cincinnati. Bart Simpson? Check. How about Bruno Mars? Several. Willie Nelson, Willy Wonka, and Winston Churchill? Yes, yes, and yes. How about a Chihuahua named Taco Bell? Yes, face palm… Applesauce, Sriracha, Tabasco, Trumpet, Trombone, Toto, Tripod, Shampoo, and Tony Montana?</description></item><item><title>Mapping the Chili Regions of Cincinnati</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-02-03/chili-regions-of-cincinnati/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-02-03/chili-regions-of-cincinnati/</guid><description>First post on my first blog ever! I created a voronoi diagram based off the locations of the two major chili chains in Cincinnati; Skyline and Gold Star. In simplest terms, the color correlates to which chili chain you’re closest to based off linear distance (not network distance). So whether your allegiance is with Skyline or Gold Star, the territories have been established!
Notes:
The restaurant latitude/longitude positions were scraped off Google Maps and imported into QGIS via a CSV layer.</description></item></channel></rss>
