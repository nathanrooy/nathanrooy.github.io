Whether it&amp;rsquo;s big cities or narrow country roads, there are details which can only be experienced from this perspective. Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m biking around and come across something I know most people don&amp;rsquo;t get to experience, I&amp;rsquo;m often reminded of the following:
The world reveals itself to those who travel on foot. &amp;mdash; Werner Herzog Traversing the world by bike, silently under your own power, unencumbered by traffic, parking, or roads in general is a freedom second to none.</description></item><item><title>Long Tiny Loop: Attempt #1</title><link>https://nathan.fun/posts/2021-04-03/long-tiny-loop-attempt-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.fun/posts/2021-04-03/long-tiny-loop-attempt-1/</guid><description>Introduction I’m not exactly sure how I initially came across LongTinyLoop.com, but all I know is that it checks all the right boxes for me.
