I finally gave in and decided to spend some time reading up on the subject and ended up implementing the Myers bit-vector algorithm1 for computing Levenshtein edit distance. I was fairly happy with the results so I wrapped the original C code in Python and uploaded it to PyPI.</description></item><item><title>Playing around with Dall·E 2</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2022-05-08/dall-e-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2022-05-08/dall-e-2/</guid><description>About a month ago OpenAI reached to a few of my coworkers and myself and gave us early access to the new Dall·E 2 model.

I ended up falling short with a 29.75 which really annoyed me. Sooo, I set a new goal of scoring at least 40 by the end of the year. It took three attempts, I got a flat tire, and had to hop a barbed wire fence&amp;hellip; But I eventually got it.
Path Design Based on the design process from my first Long Tiny Loop attempt, I had a general idea of what I wanted to keep and what I wanted to improve for my second attempt.</description></item><item><title>The Quantified Bike Explore</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2021-06-17/the-quantified-bike-explore/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2021-06-17/the-quantified-bike-explore/</guid><description>There are few things I find consistently more enjoyable than exploring my surroundings from the perspective of a bicycle. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s big cities or narrow country roads, there are details which can only be experienced from this perspective. Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m biking around and come across something I know most people don&amp;rsquo;t get to experience, I&amp;rsquo;m often reminded of the following:

It involves bikes, maps, algorithms, and it’s a competition! So what is Long Tiny Loop?

For most ground vehicles with a pressure dominated drag contribution this ends up being the cross-sectional area as seen from the front (or projected onto the inlet plane). Most of the time, acquiring these values is pretty easy, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with some nice clean CAD files. Annoyingly though, sometimes all you have are the non-parametric, triangulated geometry (STL) files.</description></item><item><title>Improved routing for OSMnx with Taxicab</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2021-03-12/osmnx-openstreetmap-taxicab-routing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2021-03-12/osmnx-openstreetmap-taxicab-routing/</guid><description>Introduction If you’ve ever worked on the geospatial side of data science or just have a passion for maps and code, you’ve probably used OSMnx.

After plugging it in and exploring it for a few minutes, I came across all my old thesis stuff. Seeing how this was before I started using GitHub, I figured I would post it in hopes that someone else could get some use from it. Even though it uses older versions of both Blender and OpenFOAM, the results should still be perfectly acceptable given that the equations of fluid dynamics haven't changed much in the last hundred years.</description></item><item><title>A Low Cost Approach to Improving Pedestrian Safety with Deep Learning</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2019-02-06/raspberry-pi-deep-learning-traffic-tracker/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2019-02-06/raspberry-pi-deep-learning-traffic-tracker/</guid><description>.plot_style line{ stroke: grey; } .plot_style path{ stroke: grey; } .plot_style text{ fill: grey; font-size: 1em; font-family:'Open Sans'; font-style:normal; font-weight:300; } POST UPDATE: Since posting this, I've received a considerable amount of interest from individuals and local city governments from across the U.S. looking to get a better grasp on pedestrian data.

Each region corresponded to being closer to either Skyline Chili or Gold Star Chili. Since a voronoi tessellation is based off Euclidean distance (&amp;ldquo;as the crow flies&amp;rdquo;), its usefulness diminishes considerably when applied to street networks. Because we&amp;rsquo;re not yet traveling around using jetpacks, I modified the distance function to use something called network distance which is calculated using Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s algorithm.</description></item><item><title>The Beautiful Commute: Visualizing one full year of bike commuting in Cincinnati</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2018-01-11/one-year-of-bike-commuting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2018-01-11/one-year-of-bike-commuting/</guid><description>Introduction 2017 was an interesting year in terms of my daily commute. Although I unfortunately own a car, I refuse to waste my life mired in a quagmire of traffic like some kind of suburban commuter. This means I&amp;rsquo;m biking everywhere, or taking transit. But not like one of those weird weekend warriors dressed head to toe in fluorescent lycra, more like hoodie and sweat pants. What made 2017 interesting was the fact that not only did I move around several times, but being apart of a rapidly growing tech startup, so did my office.</description></item><item><title>Evolving Simple Organisms using a Genetic Algorithm and Deep Learning from Scratch with Python</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2017-11-30/evolving-simple-organisms-using-a-genetic-algorithm-and-deep-learning/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2017-11-30/evolving-simple-organisms-using-a-genetic-algorithm-and-deep-learning/</guid><description>Introduction A few weeks ago I got pretty deep into a late night YouTube rabbit hole, and somewhere around evolving soft body robots, I came across this video (here).

After failing to find a GitHub repo for this, I decided to spend a few hours coding my own version in Python.</description></item><item><title>Do We Actually Need to Replace the Western Hills Viaduct?</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2017-11-29/western-hills-viaduct-spatial-analysis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2017-11-29/western-hills-viaduct-spatial-analysis/</guid><description>Introduction and Background If you live in the Cincinnati area, by now you should have heard that the Western Hills Viaduct is in a fairly dire situation at the moment and calls for a replacement have reached an almost fevered pitch. While all this squealing for a replacement has been going on, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if a replacement was actually what Cincinnati needs? As it currently stands, it requires $1 million per year just to maintain and a replacement is expected to cost $335 million.</description></item><item><title>Differential Evolution Optimization from Scratch with Python</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2017-08-27/simple-differential-evolution-with-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2017-08-27/simple-differential-evolution-with-python/</guid><description>Besides particle swarm optimization (PSO) which I touched on previously, differential evolution (DE) is one of my go-to favorites. Just like PSO, differential evolution falls within the evolutionary algorithms (EA) family. Differential evolution is very similar to genetic algorithms (GA) which are based on the principles of evolutionary biology such as mutation, crossover, and selection. The downside of genetic algorithms is that at their core, they are based on a bit level information structure.</description></item><item><title>Mapping the Age of Cincinnati</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2017-02-15/the-age-of-cincinnati/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2017-02-15/the-age-of-cincinnati/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been really impressed by those &amp;ldquo;age of&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; maps that I see from time to time on the internet (see here, here, and here) so I thought I would give it a go this winter while I had a little free time.

This prompted me to implement a Python version of the Vincenty's inverse formula. Unlike the Haversine method (which I posted about previously) of directly calculating the great-circle distance between two points on a perfectly spherical Earth, Vincenty's formulae is an iterative method which more realistically assumes Earth as an oblate spheroid.</description></item><item><title>Mapping out the Southern Cultural Divide in America</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-12-14/southern-cultural-divide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-12-14/southern-cultural-divide/</guid><description>I just finished the book American Theocracy by Kevin Phillips (which is a seriously good book!) but in one of the chapters they included a map showing the regions of the United States which identify as “Southern” versus “American”.

One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is through the use of Bézier curves. For this tutorial, we’re not going to manipulate an existing geometry, rather we’re going to generate the geometry from scratch using a series of connected Bézier curves called a composite Bézier curve.
A quadratic Bézier curve is defined using three control points.</description></item><item><title>Calculating the Distance Between Two GPS Coordinates with Python (Haversine Formula)</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-09-07/haversine-with-python/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-09-07/haversine-with-python/</guid><description>A lot of my posts recently have focused on the analysis of spatial data coming from either the GPS on my phone (collected through Strava) or geo-tagged tweets. Because of this I ended up writing my own Python module for calculating the distance between two latitude/longitude pairs. This is accomplished using the Haversine formula. While more accurate methods exist for calculating the distance between two points on earths surface, the Haversine formula and Python implementation couldn’t be any simpler.</description></item><item><title>Montréal’s Language Distribution According to Twitter…</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-09-01/language-of-montreal-according-to-twitter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-09-01/language-of-montreal-according-to-twitter/</guid><description>Over the span of roughly eight months I was able to collect 1,116,442 tweets using the Tweepy Python library which facilitates easy access to the free Twitter API. If eight months sounds like a long time for only a ~1M tweets, that’s because the free Twitter API only gives access to roughly 1% of the total Twitter stream or “firehose”. Since saving the actual tweet goes against the user agreement, I only saved a lat/lon location and a language type within a single SQL database.</description></item><item><title>Cincy to Dayton and Back by Bike / My First Century!</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-08-31/cincy-to-dayton-bike-ride/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-08-31/cincy-to-dayton-bike-ride/</guid><description>Since I had some time off recently, I decided to finally try and bike to Dayton and back in one day.

Developed in 1995 by Eberhart and Kennedy, PSO is a biologically inspired optimization routine designed to mimic birds flocking or fish schooling. I’ll occasionally use PSO for CFD based aerodynamic shape optimization, but more often than not, it’s for a machine learning project. PSO is not guaranteed to find the global minimum, but it does a solid job in challenging, high dimensional, non-convex, non-continuous environments.</description></item><item><title>Mapping the White Castle/Krystal Divide</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-08-01/white-castle-krystal-divide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-08-01/white-castle-krystal-divide/</guid><description>Ahh White Castle.

Yes, face palm… Applesauce, Sriracha, Tabasco, Trumpet, Trombone, Toto, Tripod, Shampoo, and Tony Montana?</description></item><item><title>Mapping the Chili Regions of Cincinnati</title><link>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-02-03/chili-regions-of-cincinnati/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-02-03/chili-regions-of-cincinnati/</guid><description>First post on my first blog ever! I created a voronoi diagram based off the locations of the two major chili chains in Cincinnati; Skyline and Gold Star. In simplest terms, the color correlates to which chili chain you’re closest to based off linear distance (not network distance). So whether your allegiance is with Skyline or Gold Star, the territories have been established!
Notes:
The restaurant latitude/longitude positions were scraped off Google Maps and imported into QGIS via a CSV layer.</description></item></channel></rss>
